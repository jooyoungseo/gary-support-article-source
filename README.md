# HTML for Gary's RStudio Support Article

I prefer to author RStudio support articles in RAW HTML and then copy/paste
into ZenDesk. This allows me to create more accessible pages, and is easier
than using their clunky WYSIWYG interface.

Articles should start with level-2 heading. The level-1 heading is owned by 
the ZenDesk page itself.
