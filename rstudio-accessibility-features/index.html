  <h2 id="intro_h">Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    The RStudio IDE has many features and options to help you work the way that best
    suits your needs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some features discussed in this article require RStudio 1.3 or newer. In a few
    cases you need to know if you are using RStudio Desktop or RStudio Server. If
    RStudio is loaded in your web browser, then you are using RStudio Server, otherwise
    you have RStudio Desktop.
  </p>

    <a href="mailto:accessibility@rstudio.com">accessibility@rstudio.com</a>.
  </p>
  <h2 id="zoom_h">Zoom Level</h2>
  <p>
    The size of text and other RStudio user-interface elements can be adjusted using
    the Zoom feature.
  </p>
  <p>
    For RStudio Desktop, use the "Zoom In", "Zoom Out", or "Actual Size" commands
    on the View menu.
  </p>
  <p>
    RStudio Server relies on your web browser's zooming features. Consult web browser
    help for more details.

  <h2 id="themes_h">Look and Feel</h2>
  <p>
    You can change the look and feel of the RStudio user interface by choosing from
    three RStudio themes, and many editor themes. Use the Tools / Global Options
    / Appearance settings pane to experiment and find the look that works best for
    you.
  </p>

    Pebble-Safe is a colorblind-friendly theme created by Desi Quintans. It can be
    downloaded and installed from the
    <a href="https://github.com/DesiQuintans/Pebble-safe">Pebble-Safe GitHub page</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    More details on RStudio's theming features are in the
    <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/115011846747-Using-RStudio-Themes">Using RStudio Themes article</a>.
  </p>
  <h2 id="keyboard_h">Keyboard</h2>
  <p>
    Many RStudio features can be operated entirely with the keyboard. Using the keyboard
    can be an efficient way to get things done whether you are a keyboard-only user,
    or just prefer to reduce how often you have to reach for the mouse or touchpad.
  </p>
  <h3>Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>
  <p>
    RStudio has many keyboard shortcuts to trigger actions, move between areas of
    the user interface, and so on. Many of these can be discovered by browsing the
    main menu, hovering the mouse cursor over toolbar buttons, and viewing keyboard
    shortcut reference from the Help / Keyboard Shortcut Help menu.
  </p>
  <p>
    Keyboard shortcuts may be customized using the Tools / Modify Keyboard Shortcuts
    menu. For more on this, see the
    <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/206382178-Customizing-Keyboard-Shortcuts"> Customizing Keyboard Shortcuts article.</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    Moving between RStudio's various tabs such as the Console and the Source Editor
    can be achieved using shortcuts such as Ctrl+1 to move to the editor tab, and
    Ctrl+2 to move to the Console. Many more such commands are found under the View
    menu.
  </p>
  <p>
    The keyboard shortcuts available for manipulating text in the Source Editor will
    vary depending which editor keybindings are selected in Global Options / Code
    / Keybindings.
  </p>
  <h3>Main Menu</h3>
  <p>
    In RStudio Desktop, the main menu is operated via keyboard the same as the main
    menu in other applications on your operating system. For example, on Microsoft
    Windows, Alt+F will open the file menu.
  </p>
  <p>
    RStudio Server, however, has slightly different shortcuts for activating its
    main menu items. As a starting point, on Windows and Linux, use Alt+Shift+F to
    activate the File menu, or Alt+Shift+H for the Help menu. On macOS, use Control+Option+F
    and Control+Option+H. Once a menu is open, use the left and right arrow keys
    to move between menus, and up and down arrows to navigate within the current
    menu, just like on RStudio Desktop.
  </p>
  <p>
    A full list of Main Menu shortcuts is available in the Help / Keyboard Shortcuts
    reference, under the title "Main Menu (Server)".
  </p>
  <p>
    If you wish to customize these shortcuts, they are named "Show File Menu", "Show
    Help Menu", and so on.
  </p>
  <h3>Navigating Dialog Boxes</h3>
  <p>
    When a dialog box such as Global Options is opened, you can move around it using
    a combination of arrow keys and Tab and Shift+Tab. Generally the spacebar and/or
    Enter key can be used to "click" a button, just like other desktop applications.
  </p>
  <h2 id="motion_h">Reduced Motion</h2>
  <p>
    Some aspects of RStudio's user interface use subtle motion or animations. There
    is an option to eliminate these via the Tools / Global Options / Accessibility
    / Reduce User Interface Animations checkbox.
  </p>
  <h2 id="simplify_h">Simplify Layout</h2>
  <p>
    RStudio's main window is quite visually complex. There is a menubar at the top,
    a toolbar, and up to four quadrants each potentially containing many different
    types of tabs which in turn contain RStudio's many features! Additionally, some
    features will open entirely new windows.
  </p>
  <p>
    This can be overwhelming when first learning to use RStudio, and potentially
    distracting even if you are experienced with the product. Here are some things
    you can try.
  </p>
  <h3>Hiding toolbar</h3>
  <p>
    If you are not going to use it, the main toolbar can be hidden via View / Hide
    Toolbar, and redisplayed with View / Show Toolbar.
  </p>
  <h3>Zooming a Region</h3>
  <p>
    A strategy you can employ is to "zoom" the region you are currently using. For
    example, View / Panes / Zoom Console will cause the Console to fill the entire
    RStudio Window. Note this is a different meaning of "Zoom" than was mentioned
    earlier in this document where it referred to changing the overall size of all
    elements in the window.
  </p>
  <p>
    The keyboard shortcut for zooming a pane is often the same as for moving to the
    pane, plus the Shift key. So, Ctrl+Shift+2 will zoom the Console; use the same
    sequence to un-zoom the Console and restore the prior layout.
  </p>
  <p>
    For mouse users, there are also widgets in the upper-right corner of each quadrant
    which can be used to maximize and minimize that particular quadrant.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another strategy to employ is zooming a single column of the user interface.
    For example, in the default layout the Source Editor is in the top-left (assuming
    you have some files open) and the Console is below it. If you then use View /
    Panes / Zoom Left Column, those two panes will expand to fill the entire main
    window.
  </p>
  <h3>Customizing Pane Layout</h3>
  <p>
    Another tool you can experiment with is customizing which quadrants contain certain
    tabs, as well as where each quadrant is displayed relative to the others. This
    is configured via View / Panes / Pane Layout dialog (also available within the
    Global Options dialog under Pane Layout).
  </p>
  <p>
    The Source and Console quadrants are currently fixed in terms of what tab-types
    may appear in them. You can, however, configure the other two quadrants to hold
    specific tabs. The only limitation is that a quadrant must contain at least one
    tab, so it is not possible to completely eliminate one quadrant. Still, you can
    move the tabs you don't routinely use into one quadrant then minimize that quadrant,
    giving what is essentially a 3 panel layout.

  <h2 id="reader_h">Screen Reader</h2>
  <p>
    Please see the
    <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045612413-RStudio-Screen-Reader-Support"> article on RStudio Screen Reader support</a>
    for details on using the RStudio IDE with a screen reader.
  </p>
  <h2 id="menu_h">Accessibility Menu</h2>
  <p>
    Several accessibility-related options are available under the Help / Accessibility
    menu:
  </p>
  <table aria-labelledby="menu_h">
    <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Command</th>
      <th scope="col">Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Screen Reader Support</td>
      <td>
        Toggles screen reader support mode on and off; requires RStudio to
        restart
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Speak Text Editor Location</td>
      <td>
        Announce details on current text editor cursor location (RStudio
        Server with screen reader only)
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Focus Console Output</td>
      <td>
        Move keyboard focus to the Console output region, primarily for screen
        reader users
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Focus Main Toolbar</td>
      <td>Move keyboard focus to the main toolbar</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Tab Key Always Moves Focus</td>
      <td>
        Toggles a mode where the Tab key will always move focus to the next
        element, even when in a text editing control
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Accessibility Options</td>
      <td>
        Display the Global Options dialog and automatically open the Accessibility
        pane
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Accessibility Help</td>
      <td>Opens this web page</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <h2 id="options_h">Accessibility Options</h2>
  <p>
    The Global Options dialog contains a section dedicated to accessibility options.
    Options for reducing motion in the user interface, and for toggling the Tab key
    to always move focus, were mentioned earlier in this article. The rest of the
    options are specific to screen reader usage, and are discussed in the
    <a href="https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045612413-RStudio-Screen-Reader-Support"> article on RStudio Screen Reader support</a>.
